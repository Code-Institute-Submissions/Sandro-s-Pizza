            In 2015, Sandro Bencinic visited Naples during his holidays and fell in love with Pizza Napoletana, the most recognized pizza in the world. As a passionate foodie and proven entrepreneur, Sandro decided to master his skills in making this truly unique dish. He was thought the secrets of making the best pizza in the world from best in the business - Institute of pizza in Naples.
            
            In 2016, Sandro followed his dream and changed career to become a pizza chef. He built a mobile wood-fired pizza oven-from the bed of the trailer, to the finishing tiles-by hand in the backyard of his home, while simultaneously developing his recipe for a naturally leavened dough. In the summer of 2017 Sandro opened his first restaurant in Dublin city center which was immediately recognized by the customers. Being a master himself now, and by using only the best and freshest ingredients, his pizza became one of the most popular in town.

            Legitimately the best pizza restaurant around Dublin. Doesn’t matter what I get I end up liking it. My partner and I have been eating here for a few years now. They make probably the best Margherita I’ve had.
